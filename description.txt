The TUA and TML 64bit team bring you a library that aim to enchance your game even more while also helping modder to do stuff that was previously considered as impossible

== v.0.1 - Initial Release ==
- Basic concept of autloading
- Even more world gen option for modder (create your own custom world) (Thanks dan yami for the idea!)
-- Modder will have the option to add preview to their custom world!
-- Remember this is not user friendly for modder, what do you expect after all? Create the world in 7 days?
-- Unlock condition for those world gen type (modder)
-- Have access to the folder of other world if the player have it unlocked

** Planned feature **
- ROI Tree hook implemention (aka those cool glowmask!)
- Old Achievement Library implementation but improved (cause I'm not implementing the proper one)
- Custom event support (like rain event, moon event, sun event and wave based event)
- Terra Energy API 2.0
- Dimension, maybe, probably but maybe
